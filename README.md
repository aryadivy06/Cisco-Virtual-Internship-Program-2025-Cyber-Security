This is for the Cisco virtual Internship Program 2025 for cyber security stream

College Network Security & Hybrid Access Project


üìú Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Cisco Virtual Internship Program 2025 under the Cyber Security stream. The goal was to analyze, design, and enhance the security of a college network infrastructure while addressing real-world challenges related to hybrid access and web usage policies.

The work was completed in three parts:

Security Audit & Attack Surface Analysis

Secure Hybrid Network Architecture for Remote Access

Web Access Policy Design & Enforcement

üè´ Problem Statement

The college network needed:

A complete security audit to identify vulnerabilities and attack surfaces.

A secure hybrid access model allowing faculty to work remotely while keeping internal resources safe.

A smart web filtering policy to manage and control internet usage without disrupting legitimate academic work.

üõ†Ô∏è Solution Approach
Part 1 ‚Äì Network Security Audit

Mapped the campus network using Cisco Packet Tracer, identifying routers, switches, firewalls, access points, and segmentation zones.

Analyzed segmentation to detect flat zones that could allow lateral movement.

Documented existing security controls (firewalls, ACLs, IDS/IPS, authentication servers).

Performed attack surface mapping to identify vulnerable points.

Proposed countermeasures considering budget and staffing constraints.

Deliverables:

Detailed network topology diagram

Security assessment report with risks and recommendations

Part 2 ‚Äì Hybrid Network Architecture

Designed segmentation based on user roles (faculty vs students).

Recommended VPN and role-based access controls for secure remote connectivity.

Integrated policy enforcement zones in the topology.

Defined authentication flows and trust models to ensure secure access.

Deliverables:

Updated network diagram showing remote access pathways

Technical documentation of chosen solutions, risks, and advantages

Part 3 ‚Äì Web Access Policy & Enforcement

Designed role-based web access rules (faculty, students, guests).

Applied DNS-based filtering and Layer 7 firewall rules for content restriction.

Added logging and monitoring systems for policy violations.

Planned alerting mechanism for suspicious activities.

Deliverables:

Updated network diagram with filtering solutions

Web access policy document in natural language

Enforcement logic explanation

üîí Key Security Features Implemented

Network Segmentation to minimize lateral movement risks

VPN-based Hybrid Access for faculty remote work
